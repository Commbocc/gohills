	<strong>Our community is facing some tough choices related to the very complex issue of transportation.</strong> Quite simply, we are experiencing significant shortfalls in funding just as our population is expanding and our congestion is rapidly increasing, putting greater pressure on our already declining transportation system. The reality is that unless we come together and deal with this right away, our quality of life — our time with friends and family– and our economic stability are threatened.

	<h2>Your Voices. Your Choices.</h2>
</div>

Whether you’ve lived here your entire life or moved here and raised your family, Tampa/Hillsborough County is your community, and we need your voice. Beginning in mid-August 2015, our *GO* Hillsborough team will host another 54 meetings in or near your neighborhood to understand your transportation needs and realities, to explore options that make sense in your daily lives, and to help you weigh in on some hard choices as we move forward.

The *GO* Hillsborough team has expertise in all modes of transportation, but no preconceived notions or plans for Hillsborough County. Ultimately, we are – together – creating recommendations that reflect **consensus around a COMMUNITY TRANSPORTATION PLAN** that you can support and help implement – a plan that will make a positive difference in your life.
