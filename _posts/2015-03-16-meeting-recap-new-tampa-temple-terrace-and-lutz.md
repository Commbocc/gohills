Last week, our GO Hillsborough team talked with people from New Tampa, Temple Terrace, Lutz and surrounding areas. These open-ended conversations, led by residents like you, covered a wide range of issues, from the amount of road construction to the possibility of expanding existing transit services.

In New Tampa and Temple Terrace, roads and transit arenâ€™t the only issues that concern residents. They also want to better enjoy the natural beauty of their neighborhoods through bike and walking trails, and see bicycles as an alternative and/or complement to their transit needs.

This week, we head to Thonotosassa and Plant City on Monday and Tuesday. Then, on Thursday, we will host one of only 4 Tele Town Hall Meetings. These are designed especially for those who cannot physically attend a meeting but still want to participate. We hope that everyone will join us and keep the conversation going. Please mark your calendar for Thursday, March 19, from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.

Then, on Thursday, dial this toll free number: 1- 877-229-8493, and enter the PIN: 110301#.

We look forward to seeing or talking to you soon!
