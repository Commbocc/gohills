The Transportation for Economic Development (TED) initiative is led by all seven Hillsborough County Commissioners, the mayors of Plant City, Tampa and Temple Terrace, as well as the chair of the HART board, and referred to as the Policy Leadership Group. These elected leaders have come together to study, develop, and create consensus around a comprehensive community mobility plan that ensures continued quality of life and economic prosperity now and well into the future.

In 2014, Parsons Brinckerhoff, the international engineering firm with expertise in transportation, joined the PLG team to analyze and validate existing data and information, to conduct broad community engagement and to recommend options for the Community Transportation Plan. This effort, now known as GO Hillsborough, is providing citizens with multiple opportunities to participate in creating our Community Transportation Plan. Whether through online town hall meetings and social channels or through more traditional methods, including public and neighborhood meetings, one-on-one discussions and community speaking engagements, every citizen can have their voice and choice heard.
