*GO* Hillsborough includes an I-Town Hall, online forums and social channels where people, resident and visitors alike may share opinions, engage in discussions and even vote on transportation ideas that they feel are best for our community. We want to hear from everyone and have your active, frequent participation, thoughts, ideas and even your criticism. In that spirit, we ask that you contribute respectful and polite comments and content, and agree to follow a few ground rules.

We do reserve the ability to remove any content or ban a participant who refuses to follow guidelines. Further, we ask that you report content that you believe violates these ground rules. In the event content or comments are removed, they do remain a part of public record; however, no one will be able to see or respond to them on this site.

**Identify yourself**. You must use your actual first and last name when you participate, including when posting any comments or participating in any discussions. Of course, you may not represent that you are any other person, whether real or invented, or imply any connection with any person or organization with which you are not in fact associated.

**Be courteous, respectful and appropriate**. You agree that your comments, ideas and feedback will be constructive and will not sharply criticize or attack another participant or their ideas, including the use of all capital, all bold or all italic letters or objectionable avatars or emojis, or excessive links to external websites.

Further, you agree to refrain from posting or uploading anything obscene, hateful, blasphemous or derogatory or anything that is defamatory, libelous or invades another person's privacy or proprietary rights.

If you need to ask yourself whether it's appropriate, it's probably not appropriate.

**No spamming or intentional disruptions**. You agree not to deliberately disrupt discussions with repetitive messages, meaningless messages or "spam." Further, you will not upload, post or submit anything that contains any viruses, cancel bots, Trojan horses, harmful code, or other computer software or program designed to interrupt another person's participation in or enjoyment of this *GO* Hillsborough I-Neighborhood Project app, online forums or social channels.

**No copyright infringement**. You agree not to post copyrighted material or content without permission from the content owner. Copyright infringement and the protection of intellectual property rights will be taken very seriously.

**No solicitation or advertising**. You agree to refrain from sending any bulk unsolicited advertising, promotional information, commercial email or other solicitation (including without limitation junk mail, chain letters or pyramid schemes of any sort) to any person through the *GO* Hillsborough I-Neighborhood Project app, online forums or social channels.

**Comply with the law**. You will comply with all applicable laws in participating in this *GO* Hillsborough I-Neighborhood Project app and will not use the *GO* Hillsborough I-Neighborhood Project app, online forums or social channels for illegal purposes.
