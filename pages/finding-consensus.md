These last five meetings (four open house style workshops and one final telephone town hall) weren’t easy. We are going to face difficult – sometimes conflicting – opinions and choices about our transportation system. We kept the focus on you, and the important decisions in your life: public safety, family and community values. We also discussed whether and how we continue to leverage our transportation investment to support job creation and protect our standard of living.

		An Important Note about Revenue Options
	</h2>
</header>

Only after community needs were clearly understood and a genuine sense of consensus was achieved, did we begin to recommend funding options. Of course, these options were aligned among the county, cities and transportation agency budgeting processes.

Revenue choices included:

* user-based fees such as tolls, gas taxes, and revenue sharing from transit oriented development

* developers' fair share contributions

* a reliable funding source, such as a sales tax may be needed*

	* The magnitude and the duration of such a tax was not assumed or considered until after other funding options had been examined.
