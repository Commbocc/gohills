We created context among a larger geography to understand perspectives about how the larger community fits together in the transportation picture. We asked you to focus on realities and possibilities: ensuring public safety, taking care of what we have – and thinking about jobs and prosperity in the future. We also asked you to consider and discuss all manner of transportation and its importance and value to you and your families.

Once these sessions were completed, we prepared "Issues and Opportunities" feedback to share with you. This report focused on what we’ve been hearing throughout the initial 18 discussions as well as offered some expert insights into potential opportunities and thoughts.
